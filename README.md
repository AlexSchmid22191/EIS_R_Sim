This is a collection of calculated reaction rates (i.e. currents) for different mechanistic models of oxygen exchange on (La,Sr)FeO3.
Calculations are based on the model for defect controlled reactions described in: https://doi.org/10.1149/2.1031912jes.
The calculations are done in python with numpy and results are stored in numpys .npy format.
