This is a collection of calculated reaction rates (i.e. currents) for different mechanistic models of oxygen exchange on mixed conducting perovskite electrodes..
Oxygen exchange reaction rates are described as a function of defect concentrations, see https://doi.org/10.1149/2.1031912jes for a detailed description.

Here, (exchange) currents, polarization resistances, dependencies and Tafel-slopes are calculated as function of oxygen partial presure and overpotential for different possible reaction mechnisms.
The defect concentrations are taken from the model material (La,Sr)FeO<sub>3-Î´</sub> (see Brouwer).
From the partial pressure and overpotential dependent defect concentrations the (exchange) current densities, resistances and their partial pressure and overpotentil dependencies are calculated.

Overpotentials are listed in V, oxygen partial pressures in bar, defect concentrations in defects per unit cell and currents are in arbitrary units as are resistances.
Partial pressure and overpotential dependencies (p and n slopes) are given unitless and (/V), and likewise with resistances instead of currents (rp and rn slopes), respectively.

Models described in the publication are 7, 8, 10 and 11:
Model 7 describes a molecular mechanisms without adsorption limitation, model 8 includes adsorption limitation.
Likewise Models 10 and 11 describe atomic mechanisms without and with adsorption limitation, respectively.
